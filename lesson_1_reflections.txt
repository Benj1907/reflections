I don't have any specific reflection on version control.
Version control is important to:
 - Be able to have development branch for new features different from prod
 - To hot fix

The pros of using manual commits is that you can commit per logical unit.
No automatic process is able to do that with 100% success.
The cons is that you may lose your work if you forget to commit.
